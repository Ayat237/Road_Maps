            <h2>Purpose of machine learning</h2>
            <p>Machine-learning algorithms use historical data to predict new output values and make decisions based on
                that information. This type of artificial intelligence has reduced workloads for many industries,
                including healthcare and finance, by automatically recognizing patterns in their records that might
                otherwise go unnoticed! With machine learning, programs can become more accurate at predicting outcomes
                without being explicitly programmed.</p>
            <p>Machine learning is great, but what makes it stand out is its capacity to predict outcomes to avoid any
                negatives in the future.</p>
            <p>A few examples of these are market demand forecasts, stock prices, and even survival predictors to see
                how feasible it is for someone to survive in a given situation.</p>

            <h2>Pursuing a career in machine learning</h2>
            <p>Now that you’re more familiar with what machine learning is, let’s talk about its applications and how it
                can be a great career choice for many people.</p>
            <p>The demand for machine learning experts and engineers is at an all-time high. The skillset of these
                professionals can easily assist companies in achieving their goals while helping them to be more
                efficient and productive. It also allows them to create data-driven business decisions and build
                products that can better serve customers’ needs and wants.</p>
            <p>According to a study from LinkedIn, the number of machine learning engineers has increased by 9.8x in the
                last 5 years. They claim that data science and ML are generating more job openings than there are
                applicants for right now, making it today’s fastest-growing technology for employment.</p>
            <p>In fact, Glassdoor enlists Machine Learning Engineer positions as part of the top 50 best jobs in the US
                for 2022 with a median salary base of $130,489. If you’re eager to learn machine learning and you’re
                excited about the future of machine learning technologies, this might be the best time to start learning
                about this field to prepare yourself for its upcoming innovations and developments.</p>

            <h1>Your machine learning roadmap:</h1>
            <h2>Step 1: Getting familiar with the fundamental theories, concepts & technologies</h2>
            <p>The best way to understand what machine learning is and how it works is by studying the theories,
                concepts, methods, and algorithms behind it. These are the basic building blocks of machine learning
                models you see in a machine-learning system.</p>
            <p>It’s a good idea to start with an overview of these elements so you can have a clear understanding of all
                the mathematical concepts you’ll learn in future courses or articles. For instance, you need to learn
                linear algebra, statistics, and probability before you can understand how machine learning algorithms
                work and the problems they solve. Also check out our specially designed data science bootcamp program
                that can help amplify your machine learning skillset to an extraordinary level.</p>
            <p>Once you’ve acquired a working understanding of these fundamental concepts, you can then proceed with
                diving into machine-learning models that are often used in real life.</p>
            <p>Here are some of the basics you can study before you get started with your ML journey:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Standard Deviation: Standard deviation is a popular metric used in statistics to measure the
                    variability, or dispersion, of a set of data from its mean.</li>
                <li>Linear Algebra: Linear algebra is an area of mathematics concerning vector spaces and linear
                    mappings between such spaces.</li>
                <li>Statistics: Statistics is a field of study concerned with the collection, analysis, interpretation,
                    and presentation of data.</li>
                <li>Probability: In statistics, probability theory is the branch of mathematics concerned with the
                    analysis of random phenomena.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Step 2: Understanding machine learning algorithms</h2>
            <p>In machine learning, algorithms are the instructions that tell a computer what to do. In some cases, they
                can be as simple as “if X is true then do Y” or more complex formulations which might have conditionals
                and iterations.</p>
            <p>Many algorithms in machine learning basically work by processing data points, having a particular output
                for each data point (for example, classifying an email as spam or not), and using mathematical models to
                predict future outputs.</p>
            <p>To help you with this, here’s a brief list of the most commonly used processes and algorithms that are
                widely taught when learning machine learning:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Linear Regression: Linear regression is an approach for modeling the relationship between variables.
                    It fits linear models to data in order to make predictions.</li>
                <li>Logistic Regression: Logistic regression is a type of probabilistic classification algorithm that
                    assigns class values to new observations in order to maximize the probability that its
                    classification of the input data was correct.</li>
                <li>Support Vector Machines (SVM): SVM is an approach for solving supervised learning problems with
                    categorical or real-valued inputs and discrete outputs. Support vectors are the training examples
                    that are closest to being on the margin.</li>
                <li>Clustering: Clustering is a technique for finding subgroups in your data. The basic idea behind
                    clustering is to take a bunch of points and find which ones belong together based on their proximity
                    to one another.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Step 3: Selecting a machine learning basis</h2>
            <p>As you start to familiarize yourself with concepts and theories, now is also the best time to choose
                which machine-learning practice you want to focus on.</p>
            <p>For now, you can start with this broad selection of topics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Supervised Learning: Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the computer is given a
                    set of training data, and the task is to learn how to map these inputs to the desired outputs.</li>
                <li>Unsupervised Learning: Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the computer is
                    given data but is not told what the correct outputs should be. The goal is to find structure in the
                    data and learn from it.</li>
                <li>Classification: Classification is the task of identifying which category an item belongs to based on
                    labeled examples. Examples of such labels are as follows: spam vs not spam, malignant vs benign
                    tumors, and so forth.</li>
                <li>Pattern Recognition: Pattern recognition is the machine learning task of identifying patterns in
                    data. The data consists of input variables (such as pixels) and target variables (such as whether or
                    not a tumor is malignant).</li>
                <li>Recommender Systems: Recommender systems are programs that predict what items a user would like,
                    given an existing set of preferences. This type of system is widely used in the Netflix Prize, in
                    search engines like Google or Bing, on social networks to predict friend recommendations.</li>
                <li>Imitative Learning: Imitative learning is a method of machine learning that involves learning from
                    demonstration. It uses observations of an expert’s behavior to learn how to perform tasks without
                    any instruction on how to solve them.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Step 4: Mastering machine learning libraries</h2>
            <p>Machine learning libraries are the building blocks of your machine learning application. Libraries are
                basically collections of functions created to make developing machine-learning applications easier by
                providing various prepackaged functionalities.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Scikit-learn: Scikit-Learn is an open-source software library for Machine Learning built-in Python
                    and is capable of running on top of either SciPy or NumPy.</li>
                <li>Theano: Theano is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical
                    expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently.</li>
                <li>Tensorflow: TensorFlow™ is an open-source software library for numerical computation using data flow
                    graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the
                    multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them.</li>
                <li>PyTorch: PyTorch is a Python package that provides two high-level features: Tensor computation (like
                    NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration and deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Step 5: Getting your hands dirty with projects or working on a machine learning side project</h2>
            <p>As you are working on machine learning algorithms, don’t forget to put your skills into practice by
                solving real-world problems. You can accomplish this in many ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Working with a startup or small company that needs data-driven solutions.</li>
                <li>Building a data science portfolio. If you’re not sure how to get started, just Google “data
                    scientist resume” and look at the example resumes. Or ask for help on Reddit or Analytics Stack
                    Exchange.</li>
                <li>Finding a Machine Learning Challenge: Sites like DataKind have ongoing machine learning projects
                    that require volunteers.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Conclusion:</h1>
            <p>The machine learning field is vast and there are many things to learn. So, the best way to start your
                machine-learning journey is by starting with an end goal in mind such as “I want my business data to be
                smarter” or “I need a recommender system for my website.”</p>
            <p>After setting your goals, read articles on the topic to get an idea of what you’re up against. Next,
                start learning about individual components bit by bit in order to have a good understanding of how
                everything fits together as a whole. You can enlist in a Data Science Bootcamp & Python for Data Science
                training to get a better understanding of how all these concepts come together in theory and practice.
            </p>
            <p>Finally, put your skills into practice by working on pre-defined projects or building your own project
                which you can show off at your next data science interview.</p>
            <p id="finalP">That’s it from us, good luck and have fun!</p>
