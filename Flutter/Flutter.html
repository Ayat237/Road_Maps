                <h1>1. Learn Dart</h1>
                <p class="p1">
                    Don’t directly jump to Flutter without knowing Dart! There is no doubt that the first step in
                    learning Flutter should be exploring a programming language
                    . In this case, it's Dart.
                    Dart’s syntax looks and behaves a lot like C#, its closest cousin. So, if you are familiar with C#,
                    learning Dart language becomes easier.
                    Dart uses Object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, so to fully understand all the mechanisms of a
                    language, it is crucial to know and understand
                    these concepts.
                    OOP refers to an object-based programming methodology, not just functions and procedures. These
                    objects are organized into classes that allow individual
                    objects to be grouped together. In Dart, everything you pass to a variable is an object. Every
                    object is an instance of a class. Even numbers, functions
                    , and null are objects. All objects except null inherit from the Object class. When we go to Dart
                    guides, we have a preview of the four most visited
                    websites. Initially, these two are worth focusing on: Language tour and Language samples.
                    They provide a brief, example-based introduction to the Dart language that can be of great help to
                    beginners. After reading these sections, it is
                    worthwhile to focus on examining the best practices for consistent, maintainable, efficient Dart
                    code. It is also very important to understand
                    asynchronous programming. Without it, we will not be able to write an application in Flutter, e.g.
                    when we have to use the REST API. A complete
                    and very detailed Dart course supported by examples can also be found here. Testing examples in Dart
                    can be done with DartPad. DartPad is an open-source
                    tool that lets you play with the Dart language in any modern browser.
                </p>
                <h1>2. Install Flutter SDK - Prepare IDE</h1>
                <p class="p2">
                    Once you have mastered the secrets of the Dart language, you can start installing the software
                    development kit (SDK)
                    and configuring the integrated development environment (IDE). The whole process is described step by
                    step depending on the
                    system on which we want to install Flutter. When it comes to IDE, you can choose from: Visual Studio
                    Code, which I personally
                    use, and Android Studio. You can install various extensions to help you write flutter code depending
                    on your preferences. For
                    VS Code, you can visit this marketplace.
                </p>
                <h1>3. Study Material Design Concept</h1>
                <p class="p3">
                    If we want to create user-friendly interfaces, it is very important to read material design rules.
                    Material Components for Flutter unite design and engineering with a library of components that
                    create a
                    consistent user experience across apps and platforms. As the Material Design system evolves, these
                    components
                    are updated to ensure consistent pixel-perfect implementation, adhering to Google's front-end
                    development standards.
                    MDC is also available for Android, iOS, and the web.

                <h1>4. Explore Widgets</h1>
                <p class="p3">
                    Widgets are an indispensable part of Flutter. They build our tree responsible for constructing the
                    view. We distinguish two most
                    important types of widgets: StatelessWidget and StatefulWidget. Without understanding the
                    differences between them, you cannot start
                    writing a Flutter application.
                    So as the naming suggests, a widget is either stateful or stateless. If a widget can change, it’s
                    stateful. When you want to add
                    interactivity to your application, you need to be familiar with stateful widgets that are dynamic.
                    The widget state is stored in
                    the State object. Flutter provides an extensive library of widgets. You can browse them
                    alphabetically.

                </p>
                <h1>5. Learn State Management and Choose Project Architecture</h1>
                <p class="p3">
                    State management is an issue that cannot be ignored when creating a Flutter app. In Flutter it’s
                    normal to rebuild parts of your UI
                    from scratch instead of modifying it. Flutter is fast enough to do that, even on every frame if
                    needed. Flutter builds its user interface
                    to reflect the current state of your app.

                    There is no single approach to state management in an application. Many alternative solutions have
                    been created, such as: Provider,
                    Bloc, Riverpod, Redux or GetIt. At Monterail, we use the Bloc pattern. In large projects, this type
                    of approach is very appropriate and
                    allows you to apply the assumptions of clean architecture.
                    Bloc makes it easy to separate presentation from business logic, making your code fast, easy to
                    test, and reusable. Bloc is easy to understand
                    and can be used by developers of various levels of experience. You can also easily test every aspect
                    of the application. Therefore, I recommend
                    that you read the bloc documentation. It is very clear. Moreover, many interesting examples from
                    which you can draw patterns have been added.
                    Many companies use this approach. In requirements for a Flutter developer position, Bloc knowledge
                    is often required. However, if you decide
                    to take a different approach, you can preview other possible solutions.
                    Clean architecture and testing are core issues when our project is large and many developers work on
                    it at the same time. In Flutter, a complex
                    UI tree of components is often built. Therefore, it is important to separate the individual layers
                    and use test-driven development, in short,
                    TDD. Probably the best course I found for Flutter in this context is the Flutter TDD Clean
                    Architecture Course by ResoCoder. Combines bloc
                    pattern with the TDD approach.

                </p>
                <h1>6. Make API Calls and Add Database Integration</h1>
                <p class="p5">
                    When you feel comfortable with building view trees and creating your own widgets, you are familiar
                    with the state management mechanism,
                    you should also focus on learning API calls. As developers, we often create applications that
                    require a backend side. The Pub provides great
                    packages such as: http or dio to perform HTTP requests.
                    If we need to store some data from our application, an inherent element is the use of a database.
                    Hive is a lightweight and blazing fast
                    key-value database written in pure Dart. This package is great for storing data in your application.
                    You should also consider integrating
                    with Firebase. As you have already seen, Flutter provides solid and complete documentation. The same
                    is true for integration with Firebase.
                </p>
                <h1>What to Do Before Preparing for the Cisco CCNA</h1>
                <p class="p6">
                    If you’re still interested in pursuing the CCNA, make sure you get access to the curriculum or a
                    textbook,
                    and also arrange for access to equipment or a simulation. You’ll want to have an opportunity to
                    build your
                    experience configuring Cisco devices as outlined on the CCNA. In this article I cover some things
                    you should
                    consider as you move toward preparing for the CCNA.

                <h1>7. Flutter Conversions Guides - Useful for Developers from Other Mobile Frameworks</h1>
                <p class="p7">
                    If you've had previous experience with other frameworks or have written natively for iOS or Android,
                    there is a great sectio
                    n in the Flutter documentation that explains how an aspect of a particular platform has been
                    implemented in Flutter. Personally,
                    I have worked in Xamarin.Forms before, so I found answers to many of my doubts. If you're switching
                    from a different platform,
                    I think it's worth taking a look at the section: From another platform?
