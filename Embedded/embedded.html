                <p>
                    An <strong>embedded system</strong> is a comupter systen that has a dedicated function within a
                    larger mechanical or electronic system. <br>
                    Embedded systems are becoming increasingly complicated as technology improves, with many current
                    integrated circuits manufactured on a single chip the size of a penny.
                    The goal of this book is to provide guidance to new embedded software developers by developing a
                    solid road map that will make the trip of
                    "What to Learn?" and "Where to Begin?" easier by offering some important keywords and skill sets.

                <p>
                    Embedded programming is a type of programming that allows you to control devices by giving them a
                    set of instructions also known as firmware.
                    Embedded software may be used to program various devices with varied features by preserving design
                    restrictions and storing the finished data in memory. Below are some of the widely used programming
                    languages.</p><br>
                <p>
                <h3> C programming language</h3>
                The most widely used programming language in the embedded sector. C is a low-level (high-level in
                comparison to assembly) language that allows you to have complete control over MCUs and memory,
                eliminating the need for manual memory management. Furthermore, C is not a type-safe language; hence,
                these are the primary considerations that should be considered prior to programming with it.
                C is mostly used to program device firmware, device drivers, and kernels, hence it is at the lowest
                level of abstraction.

                    Risk-V ,x86 etc. Try to learn there instruction sets and Architecture.

                <h1> #5 Communication Protocols</h1>
                <p>Communication protocols have a specific position in embedded systems because they allow for the
                    efficient transmission of data between components.
                    There are many protocols in the embedded world, but we will encounter just a handful of them more
                    frequently than the rest.
                    Lets find out different such protocols</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong> SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) Protocol : </strong>SPI is a full duplex protocol
                        that establishes communication using a master slave setup. This protocol was created by Motorola
                        in 1980.
                        SPI is utilised in microcontrollers with EEPROM, LCD screens, and other interfaces.</li>

                    <li><strong>I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) Protocol : </strong>I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) is a
                        two-wire serial bus communication protocol developed by Philips Semiconductors in 1982.
                        It is a two-wire communication interface that is frequently used in embedded systems to link
                        low-speed devices such as microcontrollers, A/D and D/A converters, I/O devices, and other
                        peripherals. </li>

                    <li><strong>USART(Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) Protocol :</strong>
                        Digital Equipment Corporation created USART, a serial communication protocol, in the 1960s.
                        It can communicate in full duplex, half duplex, and simplex modes. This is one of the most
                        widely used protocols, and practically all microcontrollers will support it.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>CAN (Control Area Network) Protocol : </strong>The CAN protocol is designed to transfer
                        data between numerous interfaces in order to decrease the complexity of communication and
                        wiring.
                        This was initially created and utilised in vehicles to provide communication between many
                        sections of the vehicle, like as the engine, bakes, and air conditioner, while decreasing the
                        amount of cabling required.
                        The CAN protocol has a unique characteristic in that data sent from one CAN device or node is
                        available to all devices connected to the CAN bus.</li>
                    <li><strong>RS-485 Protocol: </strong> Another common protocol for linking microcontrollers to
                        external devices is RS-485.
                        When data must be transferred over hundreds of metres, this protocol is quite useful. Most
                        microcontrollers, like Ethernet, need additional chips like MAX485 to implement this protocol.
                        Using this protocol, several devices may use the same interface and exchange data. Here's more
                        information about the RS-485 protocol. In the RS-485 protocol, these are the pins that are used.

                <h1>#6 Sensors and Datasheets.</h1>
                <p>Learning and understanding how sensors work and how to interface it with the controller is most of
                    the embedded development is all about.
                    The best way to understand a sensor is to learn its datasheet , understand its working modes ,
                    registers , and operation. Once you are familiar with this it will be easy to debug and interface
                    them.
                    Knowing how to make libraries or API codes for sensor by reading the datasheet id one of the main
                    skillset needed for any embedded developer.
                    If you understand the datasheet you can easily create or port the header files easily .</p>
                <h4>Steps for creating API codes for sensors</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Study the Datasheet</li>
                    <li> Map out the registers and its functionality.</li>
                    <li> Understand the interfacing protocol and data to read and write.</li>
