                <h1>The 5 Easiest CompTIA Exams Ranked</h1>
                <img src="exams.jpg">
                <p class="p1">
                    This article is about the easiest CompTIA exams for IT and cybersecurity. You can also check out our
                    article
                    on whether CompTIA certifications are worth it here.
                    A former student of mine recently asked me which of the CompTIA certifications are the easiest to
                    pass. He
                    was interested in taking several of the CompTIA certifications, but wanted to do them in order from
                    easiest to
                    hardest. After considering his question, I ranked the top five easiest CompTIA certifications in
                    order, which I
                    explain in this article.
                    So, what are the easiest CompTIA certification exams? The easiest exams offered by CompTIA are the
                    Network+, Server+, A+, Security+, and CySA+. Most test takers will find these exams to be the
                    easiest
                    if taken in this order.
                    Let’s dive into these exams and talk about the five easiest CompTIA exams ranked in order.
                </p>
                <h1>1. Network</h1>
                <p class="p1s">
                    The CompTIA Network+ tops our list of easiest exams offered by CompTIA, because it requires a
                    manageable
                    amount of content knowledge which can be easily reinforced by hands-on practice. I consider the
                    Network+
                    actually easier than the suggested prerequisite A+, because the A+ is overwhelming with facts that
                    have to be
                    memorized, such as connector types and so on.
                    This is not to say that the Network+ is easy – every IT or cybersecurity exam poses a challenge of
                    some level,
                    even to experienced professionals. But the Network+ is a manageable exam that can be earned without
                    a lot of
                    hands-on experience, and contains content that isn’t too hard to absorb. This is why the Network+ is
                    my
                    recommended first certification for most aspiring IT and cybersecurity professionals.
                    Challenges of the Network+
                    Some people have found the Network+ to be challenging, and those that have not passed it, but have
                    passed
                    other exams, seem to fall into the category of finding the Network+ content to be dry, and therefore
                    more
                    difficult to focus on studying.
                    If you’re preparing for the Network+, be sure to cover the material thoroughly and work through labs
                    as well.
                    Understanding the critical concepts of the exam, such as the OSI model and subnetting is important
                    as well.
                    May feel unnecessary for those pursuing a cybersecurity career.
                </p>
                <h1>2. Server+</h1>
                <p class="p2">
                    The second easiest exam offered by CompTIA (in my opinion) is the Server+. The Server+ hasn’t gained
                    the
                    popularity of many of the other exams offered by CompTIA, but its relative ease to pass makes it an
                    attractive
                    certification to pursue for those looking to put more letters after their name.
                    The Server+ feels like a mashup of the A+ and Network+ with a few server concepts built in, and
                    packaged in
                    an easier exam format than either of those two exams. This means that test takers who have passed
                    either the
                    A+ or the Network+, or have passed both, should be able to make quick work of the Server+ exam with
                    adequate preparation.
                    Challenges of the Server+
                    The biggest issue facing those preparing for the Server+ is the limited amount of study content
                    available for
                    the exam. When people ask me which study books I recommend for this exam, I answer “all of them”
                    because
                    there are so few anyway, and you should read more than one.
                    A minimal amount of study material available on the market.
                    Fewer other test takers to share experiences with.
                </p>
                <h1>3. A+</h1>
                <p class="p3">
                    The CompTIA A+ ranks third on my list of easiest CompTIA exams because it is really an entry-level
                    exam,
                    but the dry nature of the content and the massive amount of memorization required to bring it to a
                    level higher
                    than the Network+ that most people take after it. Plus the fact that the A+ requires two exams worth
                    of
                    content means that it is a time-consuming certification to prepare for.
                    Since test takers are allowed to skip past the A+, and can jump to the Network+ or Security+
                    effectively, those
                    that are planning on a cybersecurity career should consider doing just that. By skipping the A+ and
                    pursuing
                    the Network+ first, test takers get an easier certification with more value that takes less time to
                    earn.
                    Challenges of the A+
                    Two exams
                    Dry material
                    Lots of required memorization
                </p>
                <h1>4. Security+</h1>
                <p class="p3">
                    The CompTIA Security+ ranks fourth on my list of easiest CompTIA exams, because it is still
                    considered an
                    entry-level exam, but is often considered the gateway certification for entry-level cybersecurity,
                    so more is at
                    stake.
                    The Security+ is interesting because it really is a conceptual exam that doesn’t require much in the
                    way of
                    hands-on experience, but does assume you have a pretty strong background in networking knowledge.
                    Because of this, someone who has passed the easier Network+ and has adequately studied could pass
                    the
                    Security+ without much more hands-on experience or practice.
                    Challenges of the Security+
                    Perhaps the biggest challenge of the Security+ is that the exam assumes you already know your
                    networking.
                    Perhaps not to the level of a true network administrator, but certainly the exam is going to pose
                    questions in a
                    way that makes the assumption that your networking chops are solid, so that the focus can be on the
                    security of
                    those networking concepts.
                    Because of this, it is often recommended that aspiring professionals, even those pursuing
                    cybersecurity, pursue
                    the Network+ first in order the get the networking concepts under control, and have the opportunity
                    to warm
                    up with an easier exam before tackling the Security+.
                </p>
                <h1>5. CySA+</h1>
                <p class="p3">
                    The fifth easiest (and at this point, not so easy) exam offered by CompTIA on our list is the CySA+.
                    I list this
                    exam here instead of the PenTest+ because I consider this exam to be Security+ level 2. This means
                    that the
                    CySA+ is certainly harder and a longer exam, but it builds on the more basic Security+ more than the
                    PenTest+ does.
                    Additionally, the PenTest+ really requires actual practice with pen testing tools, which is
                    experience that most
                    beginners just do not have. The CySA+ requires experience too, but that experience doesn’t appear to
                    be as
                    intense or demanding as what you’d need for the PenTest+.
                    Challenges of the CySA+
                    The CySA+ is probably the first exam on our list here that really commands some level of experience.
                    So
                    much so that I think most people would struggle with this exam without logging some practice hours
                    in a lab
                    environment or actual work environment.
                    If you’re interested in the CySA+, be sure to make sure you’ve allowed the Security+ content to
                    settle in and
                    you’ve spent some time with security tools, such as vulnerability scanning software. Exams at the
                    intermediate level, such as the CySA+ and PenTest+, are really going to test you on how you would
                    handle
                    real scenarios, which requires that critical amount of experience and practice.
                </p>
