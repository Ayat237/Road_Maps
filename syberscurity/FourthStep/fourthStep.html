                <h1>3 Certifications You Should Consider After Network+</h1>
                <img src="network 720px.jpg">
                <p class="p1">
                    If you’ve recently passed the CompTIA Network+, congratulations! Earning the Network+ is a great
                    step toward starting or furthering
                    your IT or cybersecurity career. Once you’ve let your new certified status settle in, you may be
                    wondering what certification you should
                    pursue, now that you’re Network+ certified. In this article, I’m going to cover what you should do
                    after your Network+ certification.
                    What certification should you get after the CompTIA Network+? The two most common certifications to
                    earn following the Network+ are the
                    CompTIA Security+ or the Cisco CCNA. The Security+ is the best next step for those pursuing a career
                    in cybersecurity, while the CCNA remains
                    helpful for those dedicated to a networking career, especially in locations with Cisco equipment.

                </p>

                <h1>Option #1: Security+</h1>
                <p class="p2">
                    One of the best certification options to pursue following the Network+ is also from CompTIA, which
                    is the very popular Security+ certification.
                    CompTIA aligns Security+ to be the follow-up certification for Network+, and for good reason. The
                    Security+ is simply a network security certification,
                    adding security concepts to the networking concepts of the Network+.
                    If you’re thinking that a career in cybersecurity is in your future, the Security+ is a no-brainer,
                    and very well may be required for some
                    of the jobs that you’ll be looking at. At the very least, the Security+ will certainly help you when
                    applying for any job that relates to
                    cybersecurity or has a security component.
                    The Security+ is a very well recognized certification, and it pairs well with the Network+. And now
                    that the Security+ has been around
                    for a while, employers are very likely to recognize it or even request it. I have seen many
                    employers what general IT employees to have
                    the Security+, and the Security+ is usually the baseline certification for entry-level cyber jobs.

                </p>

                <h1>How Soon Should You Sit for the Security+?</h1>
                <p class="p3">
                    Once you’ve completed the Network+, you may be wondering how soon you should be scheduling your
                    Security+ certification. These two exams have a great
                    deal of overlap in content, they have a similar level of difficulty, and their formats are similar
                    as well. Because of these factors, the worst thing
                    you can do is to let the studying that you did for Network+ go to waste by taking to long to move on
                    to the Security+.
                    The best strategy here is to continue to study and build on your Network+ knowledge by adding on the
                    Security+ material. Even though you may feel
                    ready for a break, letting your sharpness with the Network+ content is a bad idea, as you’ll have to
                    relearn that when you decide to move on to the
                    Security+. Keep pressing forward and the Security+ will be that much easier.
                    I recommend for most of my students to sit for the Security+ within four weeks following their
                    successful Network+ exam. You can move that up or back,
                    depending on how well you did on the Network+. For example, some students who are really strong on
                    the Network+ and had no issue at all with the exam
                    can sit for the Security+ within two weeks with relative ease. Others, who have not worked with
                    security concepts before may take four to five weeks.
                    Rarely is taking longer than five weeks beneficial for anyone.

                </p>

                <h1>What Study Strategy Should You Use for the Security+</h1>
                <p class="p3">
                    Since you were successful on the Network+, and the exams are similar in format, a similar study
                    strategy is probably your best bet,
                    as long as you keep in mind that the Security+ exam may be somewhat harder for you.
                    Personally, I felt that the Security+ was more difficult than the Network+,
                    and most people that visit the site here at StartaCyberCareer.com do say that too,
                    but I’ve also heard some say that the Network+ was the more challenging of the two for
                    them. This depends on your background, so be sure you don’t underestimate the Security+
                    as you prepare. If you’re ready to sit for the Security+, check out my Security+ Success
                    Bundle here.

                <h1>Option #2: Cisco CCNA</h1>
                <p class="p3">
                    The second major option to follow your Network+ certification would be the CCNA certification from
                    Cisco. Many employers will see this as
                    somewhat of an overlap of the Network+, but it is still valuable, even for employers that don’t use
                    Cisco equipment.
                    I have talked with major networking employers that do use Cisco equipment, and for them, the Cisco
                    certifications are mandatory, so the
                    CCNA still has a good market presence. If you’re going to choose between this and the Security+
                    mentioned above, it really comes down
                    to your desired career focus.
                    For anyone that wants to go deep into networking, and is not concerned much about a career directly
                    in cybersecurity, pursuing the CCNA
                    is probably the next best step. This is also reinforced by the additional higher level Cisco
                    certifications that are available following
                    the CCNA, such as the CCNP and CCIE, etc.
                    Cisco offers many certifications that focus on various products and levels. You could spend several
                    years just pursuing networking related Cisco
                    certifications, so if that’s your path, spending time on security-based certifications may end up
                    being a distraction.

                </p>
                <h1>How Soon Should You Sit for the CCNA?</h1>
                <p class="p5">
                    Preparing for the CCNA is going to take a little more time for many people that it would take to
                    prepare for the Security+, since the CCNA
                    is a practical exam, where you’ll need to have experience with the equipment, at the very least in a
                    lab setting.
                    The Security+, being a primarily theoretical exam, does not command the same amount of hands on
                    experience. Therefore, if you don’t have experience with
                    Cisco equipment or the Cisco operating system IOS, you have some work ahead of you.
                    Most people I’ve worked with will need about 6 weeks of practice for the CCNA, following their
                    successful Network+ exam. This may be as short as three weeks
                    for those that have Cisco experience, but rarely is it less than that. If you have no experience
                    with Cisco’s operating system, then you may need a full two
                    months to get ready, or more, depending on where you’re starting from.
                    The bottom line is that, in my opinion, you can’t and shouldn’t try to rush your preparation for the
                    CCNA, like you can the Security+, simply because the CCNA
                    is different from the Network+ you’ve already done.
                </p>
                <h1>Option #3: Python PCAP</h1>
                <p class="p6">
                    You could also go in a different direction and prove your ability in a new skill set by earning the
                    PCAP certification.
                    This is one of the few certifications that show ability in basic Python programming, and while the
                    certification isn’t
                    well known, it is pretty inexpensive and doesn’t appear to be that challenging for someone that has
                    been coding in Python for a few months.

                </p>
                <h1>Exams to Avoid Following the Network+</h1>
                <p class="p7">
                    Now that I’ve covered the best two options for a follow up certification to the Network+, I want to
                    spend a moment listing the
                    exams that I think are not good follow up exams for Network+.
                    Many people are interested in the CySA+ and PenTest+ certifications, also from CompTIA (see my
                    articles on the easiest CompTIA certs here),
                    but these exams are intermediate-level exams, and certainly more difficult than the Network+ or
                    Security+. Don’t make the mistake of jumping
                    right to either of these exams unless you have some experience in those topics in the field.
                    Another unnecessary move following the Network+ is to go back and earn the A+, if you don’t already
                    have that. The Network+ overrides and
                    supersedes the A+, so unless you are dead set on becoming a helpdesk technician, the A+ is going to
                    be limited in what it can do for you.
                    My recommendation is that the A+ should only be pursued in this scenario if a) the employer is going
                    to pay for it, b), the employer is going
                    to pay for the training, or c) you’re required to get it or will get a raise for completing it.
