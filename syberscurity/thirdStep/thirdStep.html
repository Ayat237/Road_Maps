                <h1>7 Important Things To Do Before the Cisco CCNA</h1>
                <img src="before CCNA.jpg">
                <p class="p1">
                    If you’re considering the Cisco CCNA as your next certification, you may want to know what you
                    should be focusing on before you sit for the exam.
                    In this article, I cover seven things you should consider doing before you take the plunge and sit
                    for your Cisco CCNA certification.
                    What should you do before the CCNA? Before taking the Cisco CCNA certification, test takers should
                    establish their basic networking knowledge,
                    build hands-on experience through a variety of formats, and familiarize themselves with more
                    advanced network configuration options.
                    Let’s jump in and look at what you can do before your CCNA exam
                </p>

                <h1>1. Take a basic networking course</h1>
                <p class="p2">
                    If you’re just starting out in IT or cybersecurity and you don’t have any real knowledge or
                    experience yet, one of your first steps should be to
                    start building basic networking knowledge (my Intro to Networking course can help).
                    Some people who have their sights set on the CCNA jump quickly into the more advanced material on
                    the exam or jump into working with the equipment
                    pretty quickly, which can create a situation where the person is working with networking technology
                    but doesn’t understand the basic foundation of
                    what they’re actually working with (read my article here about how hard the CCNA really is).
                    If you are truly new to the field and don’t have any networking knowledge at all, consider first
                    taking a networking basics course. You should
                    definitely consider this if you’re trying to learn the CCNA on your own. I’ve found it to be pretty
                    effective to run people through the basics
                    of networking first so that they can judge their interest and aptitude for the subject before having
                    them jump into the CCNA content. This also
                    enables me as their instructor to get them hands-on with equipment quickly, once we get into the
                    CCNA material.
                    Now it is true that the official CCNA curriculum does include basic networking content, but it also
                    gets hands on pretty quickly, which is why taking a
                    basic networking course first may be helpful if you’re studying on your own without the benefit of
                    access to an instructor.

                </p>

                <h1>2. Consider Taking the CompTIA Network+ First</h1>
                <p class="p3">
                    I’ve talked about the similarities between the Cisco CCNA and the CompTIA Network+ before, and have
                    found that if you have a choice between the
                    two, most people would benefit from taking the Network+ first (see my article here about why you
                    should take the Network+ before CCNA).
                    If you haven’t earned your CompTIA Network+ yet, and you are interested in both of these
                    certifications, one option for you to consider before you
                    take the CCNA would be to instead prepare for and sit for the Network+. The Network+ exam will
                    require less preparation, study, and hands-on
                    experience, and therefore can be earned more quickly than the CCNA (here’s why the Network+ is worth
                    it). And the Network+ is well recognized by
                    employers as well.
                </p>

                <h1>3. Download Packet Tracer from Cisco’s netacad.com Site</h1>
                <p class="p3">
                    If you’re taking an official CCNA course with an instructor, your instructor may already have you
                    working with Cisco’s Packet Tracer software to
                    complete labs related to the course material.
                    However, if you’re self-studying for the CCNA, and especially if you don’t have access to real
                    equipment, one thing to do before taking the CCNA
                    would be to download Packet Tracer software and practice working with the virtual equipment in the
                    program.
                    Packet Tracer is a proprietary network simulation program developed and maintained by Cisco that is
                    designed to help CCNA test takers work through
                    labs associated with the CCNA material. Cisco makes the Packet Tracer program available to everyone
                    for free at their site netacad.com (You will
                    have to create an account and jump through a few hoops, but you’ll still be able to download it.)
                    Here are some time-saving tips for using Packet
                    Tracer.
                    Packet Tracer has some limitations, but for the CCNA, it is a pretty good tool to practice working
                    with Cisco commands and configurations that you may
                    see on the exam, and it provides a quick way to mock up a network topology and try out a
                    configuration, which would be much more involved with real
                    equipment.
                </p>

                <h1>4. Set Up a Wifi Network</h1>
                <p class="p3">
                    Another thing that I recommend test takers do before sitting for the CCNA is to spend some time
                    configuring an actual home or small-office wireless
                    network. Modern wireless routers are inexpensive, readily available, and have an amazing volume of
                    networking protocols and options built in that
                    you can practice working with.
                    For example, most wireless devices have switch ports, routing, NAT, DHCP, firewall, encryption,
                    VLANs, and many other features already built in.
                    Working with one of these devices, even if it’s not Cisco, is a great way to reinforce what you’ve
                    learned in your CCNA preparation, all in one
                    device. No other device that is covered in depth on the CCNA can provide so much variety.
                </p>
                <h1>5. Complete Lots of Labs</h1>
                <p class="p5">
                    If you’ve been following along so far, you’ve already downloaded Packet Tracer and gotten hands on
                    with real Wi-Fi equipment. Now that you’ve
                    downloaded Packet Tracer, a great next step is to go through labs for the CCNA.
                    If you’re taking an actual CCNA course, you already have access to dozens of step-by-step labs that
                    you can and should do. If you’re not
                    taking a CCNA course, you can still find hundreds of CCNA related labs online by doing a basic
                    internet search.
                    At this stage in your preparation for the CCNA, working through actual labs will give you a variety
                    of experiences that will help prepare
                    you for anything that the actual CCNA exam might throw at you. Don’t make the mistake of completing
                    a video course or reading a CCNA textbook
                    but skimping on the time you spend working with labs, since this will be one of the best ways for
                    you to reinforce your CCNA networking knowledge.
                </p>
                <h1>6. Get Experience on Actual Equipment</h1>
                <p class="p6">
                    Now that we’ve covered getting hands-on with basic equipment, such as a Wi-Fi router, you should
                    also consider any opportunity that you can find
                    to work with actual equipment that the CCNA exam covers (to see how to get hands-on experience for
                    all things cyber, check this article out.)
                    Getting access to this equipment is often easier said than done, but if you are taking a CCNA course
                    at a college, your college may have a lab
                    available to you. Also, many of the actual Cisco devices can be purchased in a used state online for
                    pennies on the dollar, meaning that you
                    could buy all of the Cisco equipment you would ever need for the exam for a few hundred dollars,
                    even though this equipment cost several thousand
                    dollars when new.
                    To be clear, many people have passed the Cisco CCNA without ever touching real networking equipment
                    (usually by using Packet Tracer), and some
                    colleges don’t even provide access to this equipment for their CCNA classes. But if you do have the
                    opportunity to get access to real Cisco
                    networking equipment, it is a great way to reinforce your knowledge and build confidence for the
                    exam. And keep in mind that no simulation
                    software is ever going to be as real as real equipment.

                </p>
                <h1>7. Watch Configuration Videos</h1>
                <p class="p7">
                    One final thing that I recommend people do before sitting for the CCNA is to spend some time online
                    watching Cisco CCNA configuration videos.
                    There are hundreds of videos available online where you can watch a networking professional
                    configure any and every topic that is listed on the
                    CCNA objectives.

                    A lot of people don’t think about doing this, but watching a professional do what you’re trying to
                    learn to do is extremely helpful.
                    It is the fastest way to learn shortcuts, witness the thought process that experienced professionals
                    go through, and see where you’ve been
                    doing things the hard way. All of these things could never be effectively explained in a book, but
                    watching a video is a sure way to see
                    for yourself how things can and should be done. And if you’re looking for more CCNA tips, check out
