                    This article is about effective ways to learn cybersecurity if you’re just getting started. If you
                    are instead looking for

                    information on how to get into the cybersecurity field, you can view our guide here. We’ve also
                    provided an expected timeline
                    for how long it can take to get into cybersecurity as well as strategies for getting cybersecurity
                    experience.

                    I’ve helped dozens of my students learn cybersecurity, even when they were starting without any
                    background knowledge. So, when
                    someone asked me about the best ways to begin learning cybersecurity, I began thinking about what
                    the most successful students had
                    done to learn the topic, even when they were starting with no background at all.


                    So, what is the best way to learn cybersecurity? The best way to learn cybersecurity is not just
                    from taking college classes – but
                    from getting a combination of education and experience. The means following a process to supplement
                    college coursework with preparation
                    for certifications, internship and volunteer experiences, cybersecurity competitions, and hands on
                    practice.

                    This sounds fine in theory, but most of us would still wonder how to even get started in gaining
                    that combination of education
                    and experience. Without a doubt, the process of getting started can feel overwhelming, so below I’ve
                    laid out a step by step plan
                    that anyone can follow.

                <h1>Step 1 – Enroll in a College Cybersecurity Program</h1>
                <p class="p3">
                    Many people are probably wondering if enrolling in a college program is an important step in
                    learning cybersecurity. The answer is yes.
                    There are three reasons why enrolling in a college-level cybersecurity program is a good idea, even
                    given the costs associated with attending college.

                    Approved and vetted curriculum. College-level cybersecurity programs are a great place to start
                    because their programs are almost always vetted
                    by outside accreditors or advisory boards. Colleges have a reputation of learning to uphold and they
                    are increasingly choosing to connect with
                    experts in the field to validate their programs and content. Colleges know that their students need
                    to get jobs after graduation, so they benefit
                    by keeping their programs relevant. Because of this, they have a stake in maintaining quality.
                    Enrolling places you around others that want to learn the field. There is a great benefit in getting
                    out of the house and into a classroom.
                    Besides the engagement and effort that attending college requires, it also puts you in a room with a
                    diverse group of people that want to better
                    themselves and have a passion for learning cybersecurity too. The connections you can make with
                    fellow students are powerful, motivating,
                    and are a good source of networking connections that you can leverage down the line.
                    Learn from local experts. Enrolling in a college program gets you face to face with instructors, who
                    often are local experts in the field.
                    College instructors may have connections to employers or internships and are good resources for
                    career advice. They are also a good source
                    of networking connections that you can leverage when looking for a job later on.
                    With these benefits laid out, it’s important to consider a few factors when looking into a college
                    program. Begin by researching college
                    cybersecurity programs in your area and consider enrolling in one that matches your goals and
                    financial means. For most people, a community
                    college or junior college is probably best. Community colleges are cheaper, government supported,
                    and student focused.


                    If you decide to enroll, just be sure that the coursework in the program is hands-on. Even though
                    it’s all the rage now, you may be better
                    off avoiding college cybersecurity programs that are fully online. These programs must resort to
                    simulators and virtualized learning systems
                    to provide the necessary educational environment, which is never going to be the same as working
                    with the real thing. These programs don’t
                    exist because they are better, they exist because they are more convenient.

                    At this step, many people will wonder how difficult a cybersecurity degree will be to complete, or
                    whether they need to get a bachelor’s or
                    master’s degree to have a shot to get into cybersecurity. Going to college, especially when you
                    haven’t been in school for a while, can be
                    a challenge, but is probably going to be worth the effort in the long run. Check out our post about
                    getting into cybersecurity without a degree
                    to gain some perspective before you decide.

                <h1>Step 2 – Get Involved in Extracurricular Learning Opportunities</h1>
                <p class="p3">
                    Once you get enrolled in a college program, begin immediately to get involved in extracurricular
                    learning opportunities.
                    The magnitude and scope of outside-the-classroom learning opportunities available within the typical
                    college environment
                    today is incredible. Here are a few to look into ASAP:


                    Student clubs and student chapters of professional associations. Cyber and tech related student
                    clubs are popping up everywhere,
                    and many technology companies and associations are now sponsoring college student clubs. They don’t
                    cost anything to join but
                    provide additional learning opportunities and look good on a resume.
                    Check into scholarships and grant programs. Many colleges have additional agreements or scholarships
                    with outside organizations
                    that can provide external learning experiences. Check with the career development or advising
                    offices at your college to find
                    out what they can offer. Check back frequently as new opportunities can pop up quickly.
                    Sign up for a cybersecurity competition. Cybersecurity competitions such as hackathons and capture
                    the flag events are everywhere
                    now. They usually don’t require a great deal of background knowledge and are a great learning
                    opportunity. Employers also love to
                    see these on a resume.

                <h1>Step 3 – Study for and Pass a Certification</h1>
                <p class="p3">
                    If you’ve followed steps 1 and 2, you’re now formally pursuing your education and building some
                    basic experience, which are the two pieces
                    to the “combination of education and experience” puzzle that we discussed earlier. Now it’s time to
                    take your cybersecurity learning to
                    the next level.


                    For the next step, consider selecting and studying for (and obviously passing) a cybersecurity
                    certification. There are many to choose from
                    that are entry level (here are the ones we recommend.) Here are two reasons why you should pursue a
                    certification:

                    Certifications force you to focus and gain a deeper understanding of cybersecurity. Certifications
                    are effective in that, if you’re truly
                    studying like you should, you’re forced to dig deep into the information. By studying to the point
                    that you can pass a certification, you’re
                    moving yourself to a level of solid understanding and learning.
                    Certifications prove to yourself that you’re learning cybersecurity. When you pass a certification
                    exam, not only does the world know you’re
                    knowledgeable in that topic, but you know it too. There is a lot of power in achieving a
                    certification and knowing you’ve met that learning goal.
                    As you can probably tell by now, I am pro-certification. While they can be overdone, they are still
                    undeniably effective in building your resume
                    and differentiating you from your peers. And the level of learning you must achieve to pass them
                    proves your learning is occurring.

                </p>
                <h1>Step 4 – Get Volunteer and Part-Time Entry Level Experience</h1>
                <p class="p5">
                    Now we’re finally to the step where it’s time to get out into the world and learn cybersecurity by
                    providing value to others.
                    Regardless of whether you get paid or not, applying the knowledge you’ve gained in the prior three
                    steps in a real-world environment
                    is crucial for your learning. Here are a few thoughts to keep in mind as you pursue this step.

                    Every nonprofit and religious facility in your town lacks technical support but needs it. Religious
                    centers, non-profits and other
                    similar organizations use computers and technology, but nearly all cannot afford on-staff technical
                    support. Tech support is expensive.
                    Is there a way for you to help and get some technical experience? Even basic IT support will help
                    you as you learn cybersecurity.
                    Many employers can’t find full time employees and will settle for part time workers. The
                    cybersecurity field is red hot right now.
                    The unemployment rate is low for cybersecurity professionals, which means employers are in a tough
                    spot. Many employers who intend
                    to hire full time and experienced workers are forced to adjust to hiring part time and entry level.
                    This could be you. And it can
                    be you, because if you’ve been following the steps above, you’re now a cybersecurity student with a
                    certification that has shown passion
                    for the field through your extra-curricular activities.
                    Your college may offer part time and student worker opportunities in the technology department.
                    These opportunities are often good because
                    the college will work around your class schedule and provide you with a good technical learning
                    experience in a non-competitive environment.
                    Don’t get focused on pay for your first gig. Remember, we’re just looking for learning
                    opportunities, so it’s not to your advantage to become
                    too concerned about pay for your first opportunity.
                    The steps outlined above do take time, dedication and determination, but that’s the nature of
                    learning cybersecurity, or anything else for
                    that matter. The most important thing is to get started and take the first step. You can check out

                <h1>Step 5 – Supplement with Online Course Options</h1>
                <p class="p6">
                    There are a lot of great online courses that cover cybersecurity basics, and many of those are free
                    or nearly free.
                    Taking an online course, even if you’re already enrolled in college courses (see step 1 above), is a
                    great way to reinforce
                    and expand your knowledge. Online courses from platforms like Cybrary and Udemy have a lot of
                    benefits that will help you in
                    your pursuit of learning cybersecurity, such as:


                    Huge variety of course topics available. If you go to a site like Udemy and search for
                    cybersecurity, you’ll see hundreds of
                    different courses that cost as little as $10 each on nearly every facet of cybersecurity. For that
                    price, you can skip the sections
                    that don’t interest you or that are already a review and not feel bad about the financial investment
                    you made. Even reviewing just
                    one section of a full course and gaining knowledge from that can be worth the money.
                    Learn on the go. One of my favorite things about online courses is that I can stream them from my
                    cell phone from wherever I am, at
                    any time. And in many cases, I don’t need to actually watch the videos, but can just listen to the
                    audio. This has been a great option
                    for me to keep my cyber knowledge always improving, even if I’m at the gym or driving.
                    Learn what you want when you want. This has been a great strategy for me. I have a whiteboard in my
                    office with a list of topics I need
                    or want to learn, in the order of importance of learning them. I can pick up a course on each of
                    those topics, one by one, and don’t
                    need to wait for the most important topic to me to come up, as I would if I was taking a college
                    class.

                <h1>Step 7: Don’t Worry About Equipment Right Now</h1>
                <p class="p7">
                    Related Questions
                    If I can’t afford college right now, how else can I get started learning cybersecurity?
                    Several companies have come out with online cybersecurity learning options that are pretty
                    impressive.
                    PluralSight and SafariBooksOnline are two favorites, but they do charge a monthly fee. For the
                    quality
                    they provide and the amount of pay cybersecurity professionals can earn, the cost is worth it. Free
                    videos
                    on YouTube often have questionable quality, which means you’re going to acquire questionable
                    learning, so
                    these should be avoided in the long term. Instead of YouTube, a better bet is Cybrary, which has a
                    very nice library of free courses.

                    What certifications are best for beginners?
