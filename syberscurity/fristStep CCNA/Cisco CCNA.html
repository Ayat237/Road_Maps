                <h1> What Beginners Should Know about the Cisco CCNA</h1>
                <img src="CCNA 720px.jpg">
                <p class="p1">
                    A question that gets asked from time to time about the Cisco CCNA is if this certification is ideal
                    for beginners. In this article,
                    I’ll answer what beginners should consider before pursuing the Cisco CCNA certification.
                    Is the Cisco CCNA good for beginners? The Cisco CCNA is a good certification for beginners that want
                    to pursue a career in IT,
                    computer networking, or cybersecurity. Beginners that have access to the CCNA curriculum through
                    their school or have the support of an
                    employer should consider using those resources to earn the CCNA.
                    Keep in mind that there are really two different concepts here to consider. First, of course, is if
                    a beginner can earn the CCNA. The second,
                    however, is if they should.
                    Let’s answer both questions, starting with if a beginner can earn the CCNA
                </p>
                <h1>Can a Beginner Earn the Cisco CCNA?</h1>
                <p class="p2">
                    The Cisco CCNA is a well-known certification from Cisco, that is an “associate” level certification
                    (as compared to Cisco’s expert and professional
                    levels, for example). The good news for beginners is that it is now certainly geared toward
                    beginners, and in my opinion, much more so than it has been in the past.

                    Cisco’s language regarding the CCNA suggests beginners are their target market for the
                    certification. For example, they state that earning the CCNA is “the first step”
                    toward an IT career, and that it provides “the foundation” for your career.

                    They also list a number of areas that the CCNA covers, including “network fundamentals” and
                    “security fundamentals”, which are good indications of the
                    basic nature of the CCNA certification.
                </p>
                <h1>What Skills Do You Need to Begin Studying for the CCNA?</h1>
                <p class="p3">
                    When you start out in your preparation for the CCNA, don’t be too concerned if you don’t have any
                    background
                    with computer networking or IT. Every major textbook and online course on the CCNA, including CCNA’s
                    own curriculum,
                    cover the basics of networking fairly well.
                    But to begin studying for the CCNA, you should have a decent background with PC usage and
                    technology, including background
                    with Microsoft Windows computers. For example, a warehouse worker that has never used a computer
                    before will have more difficulty learning
                    the CCNA material than someone with basic computer experience.
                    Here are the skills I recommend you have before you start your CCNA journey:
                    Experience using a Windows-based computer, including using software applications and internet
                    browsers.
                    If you don’t have basic computer experience, you may want to consider a basic computer course first.
                    Preferably, some experience setting up or troubleshooting technology. This can simply include
                    setting up
                    or connecting your home computer, home internet router, or cell phone. Having this extra experience
                    will
                    be helpful for the troubleshooting and configuration you’ll need to do.
                    Experience studying new concepts or studying for a professional skill.
                    If it’s been quite a while since you’ve been in school, and you don’t read or study on a regular
                    basis,
                    you’ll want to make sure your study skills are strong enough to be able to absorb the new material.
                </p>
                <h1>Should a Beginner Earn the Cisco CCNA?</h1>
                <p class="p3">
                    Now that we’ve established that a beginner is capable of earning the CCNA, let’s address whether
                    they should. In other words, is the CCNA a good certification for beginners?

                    There are several factors that you should consider in order to determine if you should earn the
                    CCNA. Let’s take a look at a few of these.

                    Is Networking or Cybersecurity in Your Future?
                    If your career goal is to get into IT or cybersecurity, then the CCNA can certainly help you. The
                    certification isn’t required to work in the field, but it
                    is helpful, and I know a lot of cybersecurity professionals that have the CCNA and earned it on
                    their way to becoming a cyber pro.
                    If you’d like to get into the networking domain of IT, then the CCNA will be even more useful for
                    you, regardless of whether your
                    eventual employer uses Cisco equipment. So if you’re shooting for a job as a Network Administrator,
                    Network Engineer, or anything related,
                    I think the Cisco CCNA is a great addition.
                    If you’re leaning toward the programming or coding route, then there are probably better topics for
                    you to focus on than the CCNA.
                </p>
                <h1>Why are You Choosing the CCNA Over the Network+?</h1>
                <p class="p3">
                    There is another prominent entry-level networking certification on the market, which is the Network+
                    offered by CompTIA. The Network+
                    is similar to the Cisco CCNA in that it also covers all of the basic networking concepts, but
                    doesn’t cover the Cisco-specific concepts,
                    including configuration of Cisco devices.

                    While both exams are challenging, there is more preparation that you’ll need to do in order to pass
                    the Cisco CCNA, since you’ll also have
                    to learn the IOS commands that are part of the CCNA curriculum. The CompTIA Network+ bypasses much
                    of this content.

                    Because both of these certifications can help your career, you’ll want to decide which one is best
                    for you (my article here covers reasons
                    why you may want to take the Network+ first.)


                    From my experience, most people that choose the Cisco CCNA first are doing so because they either
                    have access to the curriculum through their
                    school and can learn it that way, or because their employer prefers it. However, plenty of people
                    that already have the Network+, or that have
                    experience in the field, do choose to sit for the CCNA, because it does have value in the field.
                </p>
                <h1>Are There Certifications That You Should Earn Before the CCNA?</h1>
                <p class="p5">
                    Besides considering the CompTIA Network+ before the CCNA as explained above, you may also want to
                    consider the CompTIA A+ certification.
                    The A+ is intended for those that want to work in a role that
                    relates to help desk, computer repair, computer technician, or other first-level IT role.

                    The A+ is not required to earn any other certification, however it does cover a good bit of
                    networking concepts,
                    so having the A+ first tends to help those that
                    move on to the CCNA. I cover some thoughts about choosing between the CCNA and A+ here.

                <p class="p6">
                    If you’re still interested in pursuing the CCNA, make sure you get access to the curriculum or a
                    textbook,
                    and also arrange for access to equipment or a simulation. You’ll want to have an opportunity to
                    build your
                    experience configuring Cisco devices as outlined on the CCNA. In this article I cover some things
                    you should
                    consider as you move toward preparing for the CCNA.
