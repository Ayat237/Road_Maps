                <h1>3 Ways to Know if Cybersecurity is for You</h1>
                <img src="How do you Pursue a Career in Cyber Security Online_.png">
                <p class="p1">
                    This article is about how to determine if cybersecurity is a good career field for you. If instead,
                    you’re interested in how to go about
                    learning cybersecurity, you can view our cybersecurity learning advice here.
                    A common question before anyone gets started on their cybersecurity journey is to ask if they are a
                    good fit for the field. There are so
                    many questions we ask ourselves when we consider getting started, and all of these we ask to
                    ultimately determine if cybersecurity will
                    be right for us in our career. Because this is a challenge that all of us face when we get started,
                    I’ve outlined a process you can use
                    to better know if cybersecurity is the right career for you.
                    So, how can you know if cybersecurity is right for you? The best way to know if cybersecurity is
                    right for you is to research and understand
                    what cybersecurity really is, get an understanding of the continual learning commitment that
                    cybersecurity takes, and go see cybersecurity in
                    action. After completing these three steps, you should have a good feeling if the field is a fit for
                    you or not.
                    Here’s how to get started:
                    Penetration Testing
                    Forensics
                    Network Security
                    Programming
                    Threat Analysis
                    Data Assurance
                    If you spend some time researching these terms online, you may start to get a feel for what may be
                    and may not be a good fit for you.
                    Now begin to consider and research these additional factors listed below. Use a job search site such
                    as monster.com or careerbuilder.
                    com to search for jobs in the areas you’ve identified above that seem most interesting, and look for
                    the following factors:

                    Are these jobs in your area, or will you have to move?
                    Security Clearances. How many are requiring security clearances and are you “clearable?”
                    Key Requirements. Are the job postings consistently referring to a specific skill or requirement?
                    Are there other requirements besides a degree? What are they are what skills align with those
                    certifications?
                    When you do a preliminary job search like this, you can take note of the salary ranges, but don’t
                    focus too much on them.
                    They vary wildly based on location, experience and clearance. At this point, you don’t want to
                    subconsciously chase a career
                    based on the money alone, because right now we’re just trying to determine fit.

                    From your job search, what trends did you notice? Did you come across a lot of jobs that require a
                    clearance? Will your
                    background prohibit you from getting into the area of cybersecurity that you want because of a
                    clearance requirement? Keep
                    in mind that a background that is not clearable doesn’t mean that you can’t work in the
                    cybersecurity field, but it may limit
                    certain opportunities. And again, we’re just looking to get a feel for the job market now.

                    If you’ve following along thus far, you should now have an idea for what the career areas are, what
                    the job market looks like,
                    and what the requirements are for those jobs. Now, let’s move on to the next step and evaluate the
                    commitment that a cybersecurity
                    career will require of us.
                </p>

                <h1>Step 1 – Research the Field</h1>
                <p class="p2">
                    To know if a career field is right for any of us, we need to have a good understanding of what the
                    field really is. To get a handle on
                    what cybersecurity really is, start by identifying the different sectors of cybersecurity and
                    related information technology. Recognize
                    that just like medicine, cybersecurity has a lot of areas of specialty. Learn about these
                    specialties and see if any seem to be more of
                    a draw for you.
                    Begin your research by completing an online search on the major specialties of cyber security. Here
                    is a general, yet non-exhaustive
                    list to get you started (you can learn more about some of these careers by visiting our career paths
                    section here):

                </p>

                <h1>Step 2 – Understand the Continual Learning Commitment</h1>
                <p class="p3">
                    If you’ve completed the first step and are still interested in moving forward, it’s time to begin
                    considering the commitment it will
                    take from you in terms of continual, lifelong learning.
                    For me, the commitment to continual learning was obvious. My father was a mason. One time while
                    helping him with work I realized that
                    the field of masonry probably hasn’t changed in a few hundred years. People are using brick and
                    stone and mortar to build things now,
                    just like they’ve done for centuries. My father didn’t have to learn new things to stay in the
                    trade.
                    So, for this second step, consider the lifelong learning commitment of cybersecurity, and if you
                    believe you’ll be up for the task.
                    Ask yourself the following questions:
                    Do you enjoy learning about technology?
                    Do you like the opportunity of getting paid for what you know?
                    Are you willing to keep your skills up to date, and continue doing that forever?
                    Cybersecurity is a field with plenty of opportunity, however there is competition, and the best jobs
                    only go to the best.
                    And the best are the best continual learners. Consider how you answered the questions above and
                    determine if you’re willing
                    to put in the continual work necessary, outside of work hours, to stay up to date in the field.

                </p>

                <h1>Step 3 – See Cyber Security in Action</h1>
                <p class="p3">
                    If you’re still hanging in there and believe you have the drive to pursue cybersecurity, the final
                    step is to witness the work personally.
                    Just like a police academy prospect needs to go on a ride-along, you need to see any job in action
                    before you can make an educated decision,
                    including a cybersecurity job. To do that, consider the following options:
                    Consider who you know in the field and ask them to shadow for a few hours. Ask questions and get
                    their feedback. You certainly know a lot of people if
                    you think about it, and those people know people. To whom do you have access that you can speak to
                    or shadow?
                    Ask a local college to sit in and observe the class. This shouldn’t be an issue with most colleges
                    if they think you are a prospective student.
                    While observing, don’t assess whether the class is challenging or if you understand the topic,
                    because you won’t since you’re just stopping by.
                    Focus on whether you could see yourself there.
                    Check out YouTube videos on cybersecurity careers. Some employers, like the NSA, have a YouTube
                    channel that they use for recruiting and to show what
                    their careers are like. Check out their channel and others like it. Just the fact that an employer
                    like the NSA has a channel should be a good indication
                    that they need people and are looking to recruit.
                </p>

                <h1>Other factors to Consider</h1>
                <p class="p3">
                    If you’ve made it through those three steps, you should be closer to a decision on your career
                    goals. There are other factors to consider
                    as well as you make your decision. Also consider:
                    Is your passion for technology really a passion for gaming? Gaming passion does not mean that any
                    technical field is a good fit; it just means
                    that you like video games. Don’t make this mistake. Make sure you followed the three-step process
                    and are evaluating a cybersecurity career
                    on its merits and drawbacks.
                    A technology career does not mean you can avoid interpersonal interaction. There will always be a
                    boss, a customer, or a vendor that you’ll need
                    to speak with. Understand now that good interpersonal communication skills are going to be necessary
                    in your cybersecurity career. You probably
                    won’t be able to avoid it.
                    Are you willing to invest the next three to five years to get up to speed and get into the field?
                    Since there’s a lot to learn, it’s going to take
                    some time. That’s not a bad thing, but it is a fact. On the positive side, that timeline is also a
                    factor that helps to eliminate the competition.
                    Good luck in your decision making!
                    Related Questions
                    How long does it take to get into cybersecurity? For a beginner, a reasonable timeline will be three
                    to five years, depending on whether someone
                    is studying full time or part-time, and what career goals they have. Getting into a general
                    information technology position first will be quicker
                    . You can see more information about how long it takes to get into cybersecurity at our article
                    here.
                    Do I need a college degree to get into cybersecurity? It appears that most jobs prefer it, and
                    certainly the higher paying and higher-level jobs
                    do require a degree. Perhaps more importantly, a lack of a degree may hurt your career prospects at
                    some point in the future. Check out this article
                    for more information on whether you’ll need a degree or not to be successful in cybersecurity.
