            <h1>Front-end web development</h1>
            <p>Front-end web development is the development of the graphical user interface of a website, through the
                use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with that website</p>
            <h2>The Roadmap to becoming a Front-End Developer</h2>
            <img src="r1.png">
            <h2>Step one: Understand the basics</h2>
            <p>In order to build a website, you first need to have a fundamental understanding of the web, how it is
                structured, and how your application fits within it.<br><br>

                What is the web, what is a server, what is a client, how do various devices communicate with each other,
                how does the website you build on your computer in San Jose end up on someone’s phone in
                Shanghai.<br><br>

                Once you have a complete understanding of networks (i.e. IP addresses, internet protocol, packets),
                databases (i.e. SQL, NoSQL, caching), clients, and servers, you can then move on to the actual basics of
                web development: coding.<br><br>

                Front-end developers work with the user (or client) facing side of the website. Their code runs on the
                client’s browser and determines how the website looks (i.e., the user interface, layouts, navigation,
                etc.), how it requests data from the server, and how it interacts with the client’s machine.<br><br>

                The coding languages used to develop the client-facing source code are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
            <img src="rr.png">
            <ul>
                <li>HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the foundation of any website. It is the code that describes
                    the content of your page, which is then rendered by the browser. You can use HTML to add text,
                    images, audio, video, and more to your website. HTML is easy to learn and the best part is, you can
                    write it in any text editor.<br><br></li>
                <li>CSS, like HTML, is not a programming language either, but a styling language for HTML. To put it
                    simply, HTML describes the content while CSS describes how the content should be formatted –
                    basically, anything that controls the look and feel of the page. This allows HTML to go back to its
                    original job as a structural language.<br><br></li>
                <li>javaScript is where programming gets fun! HTML structures our content, and CSS stylizes it. These
                    are great to create static websites. JavaScript allows us to implement dynamic elements into your
                    website, such as interactive maps, animations, updates, and more.<br><br></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Step two: Go beyond the language</h2>
            <p>Now you know the concepts for how to write basic front-end code to create structured, stylized, and
                dynamic websites. Let’s see how we can push this knowledge even further. We will discuss the following:
                frameworks, command line, and version control.<br><br>

                Web Frameworks make the development and integration of front- and back-end programming easier. A web
                framework is basically a package of files and folders of standardized code which can be used as a basis
                to start building a site. In other words, it’s a starter pack that allows you to build on it.<br><br>
                The most common frameworks available to front-end developers are:<br><br></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Angular</li>
                <li>React.js</li>
                <li>Vue.js</li>
                <li>Bootstrap</li>
                <li>Semantic-UI</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="r33.png">
            <p>Each framework has its own pros and cons. Some are strict and fixed, while others are very loose and only
                give guidelines. Do your research to find the framework that works for you and use them to take your
                skills to the next level.<br><br>

                Command Line basics are essential to becoming a developer. The Command Line Interface (CLI) is a tool
                into which you can type commands to make the computer performs tasks.<br><br>

                Commands can be combined to achieve a variety of outcomes, and since you’re able to communicate with the
                computer directly, this is the more powerful and efficient way to control your tasks. The most common
                CLI is the Bash Shell, which is the default on Linux and Mac systems.<br><br>

                Every developer has their own ideas about the best ways to code/program a website, but they all agree
                that Version Control is the most essential part of building a website. Version Control manages all your
                project’s files so that you can keep track of all your builds and changes.<br><br>

                Git is the world’s most popular version control system due to its flexibility. It remembers any change
                ever made to a project, making it easy to revert to earlier versions; it allows for multiple people to
                work on a project simultaneously.<br><br></p>
            <h2>Step three: Trial and error</h2>
            <p>You know that thing they say about needing 10,000 hours of doing something in order to become an expert
                at it? They’re right.

                Once you’ve learned how to code and how to build powerful applications that do exactly what you need
                them to do, the only way you can get better is to practice.<br><br>

                Build sample websites. That neighbor of yours who wants to be a poet? Help her create an interactive
                page with a twitter scroll and links to her published works. Your cousin that sells terracotta jewelry
                on Etsy? Build her website with photos, reviews, testimonials, links to her social media, and
                more.<br><br>

                The more you practice and the more you build, the more intuitive the entire process will become for you.
                Before you know it, building websites and applications will become second nature.<br><br>

            </p>
            <img src="r4.jpg">
            <h2>Step four: Keep learning</h2>
            <p>The internet keeps changing and new and more advanced methods of programming launch every day. It is
                essential that you keep up-to-date with new technologies and keep learning.<br><br>

                This is not to say that what you have learned so far will not matter. Your basics will always give you
                an advantage. But in order to grow, you must keep track of what is cutting-edge, and update your skills
                accordingly.<br><br>
