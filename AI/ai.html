            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Disruptive innovations, such as artificial intelligence (AI), are changing the rules of competition
                within industries all over the globe. Opportunities associated with AI are considered to be the most
                important technological development, with regards to its enormous potential for adding value and
                competitive advantage.</p>
            <p>AI can be described as intelligent systems created to use data, analysis, and observations to perform
                certain tasks without needing to be programmed to do so. The potential is thus derived from
                opportunities to automate decision making processes through human-like reasoning—which has created a
                hype among many industries and firms. AI can be categorized as a capital–labor hybrid with the ability
                to self-learn, continuously improve and quickly scale-up. As described by O’Leary, AI often
                create the foundation for decision support through valuable insights and results, collected from large
                and complex data sets and compressed into a manageable scale.</p>
            <p>Baden-Fuller and Haefliger highlight that technology and business performance are interlinked through
                the business model (BM). The authors also explain the importance of user engagement and openness
                regarding the BM to enable technological development, which highlights the importance to consider BMs
                when implementing AI. The process of value creation is one of the main segments of business model
                innovation (BMI) that is clearly connected to AI through its ability to solve complex problems based on
                large data-sets. BMI unlocks the potential to refine or expand current product portfolios, and
                operate more efficient in order to cut costs. However, according to Valter et al. There is a gap
                between the technological advancements and how organizations operationalize value creation through their
                BM. This means that BMs must constantly be adapted to the environment it is operating in. In
                addition to value creation, value capturing and delivery are also vital parts of the BM. Teece
                describes the essence of a business model as defining the manner by which the enterprise delivers value
                to customers, entices customers to pay for value, and converts those payments to profit.</p>
            <p>Technological progress within the area of AI has led to increased interest among a wide range of
                businesses. According to the Artificial Intelligence Global Executive Study and Research Report by
                Ransbotham et al. 90% of the respondents revealed that AI offers opportunities for the company.
                However, 40% of the respondents reported that significant investments did not result in business gains.
                Barriers for successful implementation of AI are associated with the technological, cultural, and
                political domain. However, strategic considerations are considered to be vital as technological
                improvements do not ensure success when implementing AI applications. This highlights the
                importance of well-structured BMs to adapt and capitalize on existing technological assets. AI is rather
                considered to be a catalyst for BMI and thus also an enabler for disruption of industries.</p>
            <p>Research within the area of AI in business contexts is growing, however aggregated knowledge within the
                subject can be considered to be limited and studies that are relevant and rigorous are needed.
                Managers are left with little support from academia when aiming to implement AI in their firm’s
                operations which leads to an increased risk of project failure and unwanted results. The hype of AI and
                its enormous potential implies heavy investments among a broad range of different industries and firms.
                However, many firms do not perceive business gains when implementing AI applications and the theoretical
                understanding of the topic is limited. Research within BMI and digital transformation is relatively
                generic, meaning that some of its insights are applicable on all technological innovations, including
                AI. Thus, we will look into the research streams of AI to identify challenges, particularly relevant
                for implementation of AI. Furthermore, research within BMI and digital transformation will be
                investigated in order to provide a deeper understanding of how companies can transform their BMs with AI
                and simultaneously manage the identified risks. The purpose of this paper is therefore to increase
                insights on business model innovation related to the implementation of AI.</p>
            <p>Our insights will be presented in a framework that can be used by practitioners to obtain a better
                understanding for challenges and opportunities when transforming businesses through AI implementation.
                The framework represents a roadmap that can be utilized as a guide when implementing AI. Additionally,
                our results will be used to identify gaps in the literature and provide recommendations for future
                research areas.</p>
            <!-- <h2>Method</h2>
            <p>This study has been undertaken as a systematic literature study approach. Search engines (e.g., Scopus)
                have been used to identify current research. To search for articles, we have applied combinations of the
                following keywords, artificial intelligence, business model innovation, and digital transformation. Our
                selection process of articles is described through three main steps below in order to thoroughly choose
                relevant data.</p>
            <p>Step 1: The Scopus search with our keyword combinations resulted in 411 articles and was combined with
                the berry-picking method. It implies that we gradually increase the knowledge within the field
                throughout the process of information seeking. This also leads to a greater understanding on how
                topics are related to each other, which leads to a more holistic view of the review. By using small
                insights from a number of different articles this method suits the purpose of the literature review
                better due to the lack of published articles in high quality journals.</p>
            <p>Step 2: During the process of information gathering, we used two sorting steps to ensure that the
                collected articles contained high quality information that suited our purpose and need. This included an
                analysis of the title and abstract of the articles where keywords and relevant information was analyzed.
                Additionally, the screening included an analysis of relevant journals, publish dates, number of
                citations and expert judgements. This step resulted in a reduction to 79 relevant papers.</p>
            <p>Step 3: The final screening was based on sorting out articles that were of value for the literature
                review, the main activity was to ensure that the articles were relevant with regard to the purpose of
                the research. In order to successfully screen articles, the full article was read.</p> -->

            <h1>Your Artificial Intelligence roadmap:</h1>
            <h2>Step 1: Understand AI and Organizational Capabilities Needed for Digital Transformation</h2>
            <p>The understanding of AI characteristics will lay the foundation for the forthcoming implementation plan.
                This initial step will primarily include upper management as the purpose is to produce a conceptual
                framework for the usage of AI and to evaluate the firm’s capabilities. Questions should be asked: Do we
                need to develop or refine current capabilities? Do we need to develop new capabilities?</p>
            <p>Research highlights data acquisition and infrastructure to be the core aspects for successful AI
                implementation. Thus, we recommend evaluation of opportunities to digitize analog processes and thus
                also enable comprehensive data collection. Such actions will subsequently mitigate risks associated with
                the garbage in–garbage out phenomena.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the transparency issue (i.e., the black-box problem) is mentioned as one of the greatest
                challenges related to AI. Market research and R&D investigation can thus be valuable in order to
                assess risks associated with AI. Definition of risks and challenges will further lay the foundation for
                commitments that aims to mitigate defined risks.</p>
            <h2>Step 2: Understand Current BM, Potential for BMI, and Business Ecosystem Role</h2>
            <p>Before BMI is initiated it is essential to understand how value is currently created, captured and
                delivered. How is technology utilized to improve offerings and exceed customer expectations? Technical
                uncertainty is derived from technological maturity and the understanding of the technology, but it is
                also depending on the external market. Thus, the first step is to interrogate current customer
                relations and how value is delivered, captured, and created to better understand how technological
                advancements can improve customer satisfaction.</p>
            <p>However, it is not sufficient to merely understand how the focal firm relates to its customers. Digital
                transformations are rarely dependent on individual firms, but rather networks of companies that are
                collaborating with a common purpose. Therefore, it is crucial for the firm to understand its
                position in the ecosystem and how they contribute to the final offering. This also includes how
                surrounding firms complement the focal firm through particular competencies and capabilities. Findings
                should subsequently be communicated to organizational members when upper management have achieved an
                understanding of the current BM, potential for BMI, and ecosystem role. This can thereby clarify how and
                where AI will be used, and thus also avoid misunderstandings of AI.</p>
            <h2>Step 3: Develop and Refine Capabilities Needed to Implement AI</h2>
            <p>Further development of key organizational capabilities can be initiated when current BMs, internal and
                external capabilities, and customer needs are properly understood. The first step is therefore enhancing
                awareness that will further enable development of tailor-made capabilities with regard to the external
                market, including surrounding firms within the ecosystem.</p>
            <p>Subsequently, a proper understanding of current BM and business ecosystem roles will highlight
                opportunities and threats followed with implementation of AI. The key organizational capabilities (i.e.,
                strategic, technology, data, and security capabilities) must be attained within the business ecosystem,
                and should therefore constitute the main focus when evaluating AI readiness. Development of
                capabilities should particularly observed to manage challenges related to the transparency issue. For
                instance, this may cover technical problem solving through R&D operations.</p>
            <p>As discussed by Matt et al. [6], the introduction of AI will often require substantial transformations of
                core business operations and capabilities, which induces uncertainty and risk. Firms can decide to
                undertake two different strategies when transforming businesses—the role as first developer or first
                follower. Bench marking activities and evaluation of surrounding firms can be performed to inspire
                development of both technical and strategic solutions.</p>
            <h2>Step 4: Reach Organizational Acceptance and Develop Internal Competencies</h2>
            <p>According to Lee et al. Digital transformations often face risks associated with organizational
                resistance when implementing AI applications. This highlights the importance of reaching organizational
                acceptance during the implementation phase. Acceptance can be achieved through numerous different
                commitments, e.g., executive pilot projects, formation of AI-teams, and broad AI training. This
                will thereby mitigate risks associated with both misunderstandings of AI and lacking trust for AI among
                employees.</p>
            <p>However, benefits derived from educational efforts are not delimited to internal knowledge gains.
                Firms are rather dependent on the external environment, including cooperating firms or surrounding
                stakeholders. Thereby, firms should seek for collaborations with partners to strengthen the
                understanding for AI applications among affected parties within the ecosystem.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, feedback loops and continuous evaluation of business performance is paramount both during
                and after the implementation phase. Feedback loops should be constructed to structure information flow
                between all affected parties—i.e., customers, partners, suppliers, or internal managers—in order to
                foster continuous improvements of the business model. Feedback loops will hence lay the foundation for
                development of internal competences and thus also secure the relevancy of attained knowledge.</p>
            <p>Feedback loops and evaluation of customer behavior can be considered to be particularly important when
                reaching new customer segments, or when new offerings are designed through application of the AI
                application. Risks should be considered to be higher as the firm lacks experience from the technology,
                the customer segment, and the solution offered. Hence, continuous communication is essential to minimize
                uncertainty and gather understanding of the new environment. In the long term, feedback loops will be
                essential in order to mitigate risks associated with misunderstandings of AI.</p>
            <h1>Conclusions:</h1>
            <p>Technical advancements and progress regarding AI related research has led to increased interest among a
                wide range of industries and firms. However, insufficient understanding regarding implementation of AI
                applications induces limited business gains. This report intends to increase the understanding of AI
                implementation by reviewing research within AI, BMI, and digital transformation.</p>
            <p>With support from literature concerning business related AI research, we have increased the understanding
                of challenges connected to AI implementation. Furthermore, research within the topics of digital
                transformation and BMI is reviewed in order to provide a deeper understanding of how defined risks can
                be mitigated. The four main takeaways are defined as a need to: (1) understand AI and organizational
                capabilities needed for digital transformation; (2) understand current BM, potential for BMI, and
                business ecosystem role; (3) develop and refine capabilities needed to implement AI; and (4) reach
                organizational acceptance and develop internal competencies.</p>
            <p>The four main takeaways presented in this literature review can be used as a guide when evaluating
                opportunities for AI implementation. Organizational character and desirable conditions differ
                considerably between firms, meaning that implementation phases will be designed quite differently.
                However, AI will reshape how business is done and business model innovation will be crucial to succeed
                with businesses built on AI.</p>
            <p>The presented framework is relatively generic and applicable on a wide range of businesses, independently
                of its characteristics—i.e., role in business ecosystem, size, or industry affiliation. Therefore, the
                validity of current research within the subject of AI can be considered to be insufficient. This affects
                our presented framework as it may limit its usefulness in specific contexts. To increase the
                understanding of AI and how successful AI implementations can be formed, we recommend four further
                research areas.</p>
            <p>First, understanding regarding AI readiness and required preconditions is insufficient. Thus, there is a
                need for measurable guidelines that can be followed to evaluate firm’s digital maturity level, manage
                unexpected challenges, and lower risks associated with AI initiatives. By developing this type of
                matrix, managers will easier understand how and when AI implementations should be initiated.</p>
            <p>Second, research regarding digital transformation partly focus on the resolution of industry barriers and
                the importance of partnerships when reaching new customer segments with advanced offerings. However, the
                transformation to AI is highly challenging and complex. Therefore, future research on transformation to
                AI cases would be valuable.</p>
            <p>Third, our paper highlights the importance of understanding the role of the industrial ecosystem. Further
                research should therefore investigate what competencies each ecosystem actor is associated with and what
                maturity level each role must achieve to successfully progress with AI initiatives.</p>
            <p>Finally, business models for AI applications are usually offered as service contracts rather than
                traditional sales. Therefore, more research on AI connected to digital servitization would benefit the
                research on AI business models.</p>
