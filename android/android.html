            <h2>Why Choose Android?</h2>
            <p>Android is a preferred platform as it does not require specific technical experience, making it easier
                for developers of varying skills to master it. The Google Play Store is replete with an estimated 2.6
                million android applications, and most of these applications are either less expensive or free to
                download. Following are some of the added advantages of choosing Android.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When businesses plan to launch a new application, android development offers them the advantage of
                    being cost-effective and has a better reach and scope for promotion. As a result, android developers
                    find a broader range of opportunities.</li>
                <li>Yet another advantage of choosing Android over other operating systems is that it does not require
                    you to pay for SDK tools or a yearly expense as a designer. While the process of development
                    encapsulates audio, asset, graphic creation costs, and coding, it is still significantly cheaper
                    than designing an app using a different operating system. With android, you can develop interactive
                    applications using any device for app building and testing, which demands low investment and yields
                    higher ROI.</li>
                <li>Android apps, once developed and tested, take only about a day to be approved and deployed on Google
                    Play Store. This eases the process from development through deployment for android developers.</li>
                <li>Android is a versatile option for application development as it allows you to target different
                    platforms, such as Symbian and Ubuntu. Kotlin is the official language built by Google for android
                    application development; you can develop applications using Kotlin that run on other operating
                    systems like iOS and Java desktop versions.</li>
                <li>Any app developer would want the application they build to be feature-rich and flexible. Being an
                    open-source platform, Android allows you to customize your android applications to easily
                    incorporate features and functions that your users might need.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Job Roles and Responsibilities of an Android Developer</h2>
            <p>The basic responsibility of an android developer is to design and develop Android-powered
                applications and integrate them with back-end services. Android developers are also required to
                coordinate with various other teams and individuals, such as the design team, engineers, and other
                developers, to work on the multiple layers of the infrastructure. They also add new features and
                tweak an existing android application to update it and make it more user-friendly. This also
                involves fixing bugs and reconstructing the performance of the application. Finally, being an
                android developer is a lifelong journey of learning and exploring new ways to add efficiency to the
                application development process and evaluating how technology can be leveraged to enhance the
                features of the app.</p>
            <p>As a budding android developer, you can choose to freelance or work at a start-up or for an
                established organization. While the way you work in different settings might differ with respect to
                the work culture, your roles and responsibilities would be more or less the same. Some of the common
                job roles that Android developers are hired for include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mobile App Developer</li>
                <li>Mobile Architect</li>
                <li>Android Engineer</li>
                <li>Embedded and Lead Software Engineer for mobile</li>

            </ul>
            <h2>Top Mobile App Development Challenges</h2>
            <img src="2.png" alt="#">
            <p>Whether you are a startup or an established enterprise, building a mobile app is challenging. To get
                started, you need the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Idea</li>
                <li>Market Research</li>
                <li>Resources</li>
                <li>Restricted Budget</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Wondering how idea can be a challenge? Well, it is. Let us understand why!</p>
            <h3>1. Idea</h3>
            <p>In the immensely overcrowded app market, what will make your app stand out from the rest? Planning to
                build an app after being inspired by another popular app having the same features won’t do any good.
                Right from the very beginning, you have to be very sure about your idea, only then your app will be
                noticed.</p>
            <p>What could be the solution? Well, you should first validate your app idea and look for the features to
                incorporate so that it will match or exceed the expectation of the users?</p>
            <p>Just continue reading this mobile app development guide!</p>

            <h3>2. Market Research</h3>
            <p>Market research is essential before you move ahead with the development process. But it is one of the
                most difficult and crucial steps in the mobile app development roadmap.</p>
            <p>During the market research, you should try to find out the answer to the following questions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Do you have an idea that who is most likely to download your app?</li>
                <li>Is there a market for your app?</li>
                <li>Will the app be easily accessible?</li>
                <li>What strategy will drive the target audience?</li>
                <li>Have you analyzed your product or service?</li>
                <li>Where will it be sold?</li>
                <li>Who is your target audience?</li>
                <li>Who are your biggest competitors?</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3. Resources</h3>
            <p>Another major challenge is looking out for resources. For tech companies, setting up a team of developers
                is far easier than non-tech companies. And for building a successful mobile app, you need top-notch
                developers.</p>
            <p>And it’s not an easy task to find out skilled developers easily. So, to ease the process of hiring
                skilled mobile app developers, do the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Learn how to check their basics.</li>
                <li>Find out how much experience they have?</li>
                <li>Do they have good communication skills?</li>
                <li>Are they creative enough?</li>
                <li>Which platform do they excel in?</li>
                <li>Can they recommend more features for the app?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Another option is to outsource your project. Just look out for a reliable software outsourcing company &
                hire app developers for app development. This way you can get your app developed from experts under your
                supervision while keeping the project cost low.</p>
            <h3>4. Restricted Budget</h3>
            <p>Start-ups usually have a limited budget but a good vision to deliver only the best. So, it becomes
                necessary to plan accordingly. Mobile app development requires a lot of investment in the research,
                design, development, launch, and marketing process.</p>
            <p>So, it is one of the most difficult mobile app development challenges. While budgeting your application,
                the following points can make a huge difference:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Whether to pay hourly or fixed rates to the developer?</li>
                <li>Are you building a hybrid app?</li>
                <li>What will be the maintenance cost?</li>
                <li>Do you want to partner with another brand?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Therefore, make your decision wisely.</p>

            <h1>Your Android roadmap:</h1>
            <h2>Guide to Becoming an Android Developer</h2>
            <p>As Android quickly became the world’s #1 mobile platform, it attracted individuals from both
                programming and non-programming backgrounds, encouraging them to explore the process of becoming
                successful android developers. As for any app development platform, android requires you to master
                certain skills. It is also crucial to know how you can start and progress to become a professional
                android developer. With that said, here’s a detailed, step-by-step guide on how to become an android
                developer.</p>
            <h2>Step 1: Start With a Programming Language</h2>
            <p>Software engineering requires you to learn a programming language, and in Android’s case, there are
                two major programming languages used- Java and Kotlin. Learning Kotlin is a good place to start
                because the language has been developed by Google as a replacement for Java. It offers a host of
                features that ease the coding process. With Kotlin, you can code with minimal chances of coding
                errors and crashes. One of the reasons why programmers well-versed in Java also learn Kotlin is
                that, besides offering extensive features, it is Java language compatible. With Kotlin, you can use
                Kotlin codes on Java and the other way around.</p>
            <p>When getting acquainted with Kotlin, the three main aspects that should be the focus of your learning
                are syntax and idioms, OOP (object-oriented programming), and data structures and algorithms. Once
                you learn Kotlin, it sets the foundation for subsequent steps to become an android developer.</p>
            <h2>Step 2: Understand the Android Application Lifecycle</h2>
            <p>One of the biggest differences between writing an application for desktop and mobile is that, while
                the operating system can manage the application on a desktop, you code your mobile application for
                handling external events. This means you need to design your application in a way that it interacts
                well with other applications on your phone. For instance, your application should be programmed to
                work the ideal way when the phone receives a text or a call. When you have this understanding, you
                can create an app that offers the best user experience.</p>
            <h2>Step 3: Learn the Basics of an Android Platform</h2>
            <p>The Android platform has various components, and it is essential to know these fundamental components
                and how to work with them to be proficient in developing functional android apps. A well-planned
                android application development training course will familiarize you with these basic components
                that help in handling the configuration changes of the app, working with the components of the app,
                testing the units, and following standardized practices for security and navigation. Once you know
                about these elements of the android platform, you can use various tools to design the app.</p>
            <h2>Step 4: Get to Know the Android Tools</h2>
            <p>Every beginner android developer should be aware of the most significant tools for android
                development and the knowledge of using those tools. The first tool you need to get acquainted with
                is Android Studio, which is the official IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for developing
                android apps.</p>
            <p>Integrated Development Environment is a software that brings together the most common tools used by
                developers in the form of a single graphical user interface. IDE is used for writing and testing
                software through different phases of development, such as building, coding, and testing. Android
                Studio helps enhance your productivity as it lowers the setup time while standardizing the process
                of development. You can write android apps for different devices like mobile phones, watches, TVs,
                etc., using Android Studio.</p>
            <p>Another tool you need when developing android apps is a Version Control System tool, preferably Git,
                which is used for coordination among developers, keeping track of changes in the codebase, and going
                back to the older versions when needed. One major advantage of learning to use Git is that it offers
                you the flexibility of handling both small and large-sized projects with efficiency and speed.</p>
            <p>Finally, you should be familiar with Gradle- a build automation tool which is part of the Android
                Studio. Gradle allows you to compile, build, and publish android applications.</p>
            <h2>Step 5: Start With Small Projects</h2>
            <p>When you have a basic understanding of the android platform and common tools useful for developing an
                application, contributing to open source is a good way to put your knowledge to test and practice.
                However, make it a point to start small as a beginner and make slow yet meaningful progress to
                bigger projects. When you contribute to open source, you can interact with your peers and the
                community, which can also bring opportunities your way.</p>
            <p>You will find a range of projects on GitHub, which are generally open to the public. These projects
                are of various types, such as bug fixing, reviewing a project, and much more. You can open an issue
                and start working on the project to master your coding and app development skills.</p>
            <h2>Step 6: Distribute Your Project</h2>
            <p>Once you work on small projects and come up with your own complete android app with the help of your
                knowledge and experience fixing various projects open to the public, the next big step is to
                distribute your android application and let it be known to the world. There are various ways through
                which you can do this, such as going to the official android market, having it on your website, or
                using a third-party website. If you plan to distribute your application through the official Android
                market, you need to register as an official Android developer and pay $25, which is a one-time fee.
            </p>
            <h2>Step 7: Share Your Journey as a Beginner</h2>
            <p>Becoming an android app developer is a journey that presents you with hurdles and hassles. However,
                it is natural for every beginner to struggle during the learning process. What makes it easier is
                talking to the community about your pain points and struggles through your learning journey. You can
                try various platforms, such as Twitter, Reddit, Meetup, or other local groups and seek help and know
                how other app developers go about their app development process to improve your ways.</p>
            <h1>Conclusion:</h1>
